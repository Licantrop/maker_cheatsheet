### Selective Infill

Selective infill is a technique used to put solid infill in critical places (like around a screw hole).

Here are common parameters for applying selective infill in Fusion 360 with Slic3r Prusa Edition 1.37.1.

I found this technique in Prusa OpenScad files, thanks for sharing!

#### Horizontal (compared to heated bed)

| Parameter | Expression | Value |
|:---------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| extrusion_width        | 0.45mm | 0.45 |
| num_perimeters         | 3 | 3 |
| perimeters_thickness   | num_perimeters * (extrusion_width - 0.05) | 1.25 |

Note that this perimeter thickness calculation is just an approximation of what the slicer will really use. In reality it is a bit more complexe than that because the slicer overlap perimeters.


#### Vertical (compared to heated bed)

| Parameter | Expression | Value |
|:---------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| layer_height           | 0.20mm | 0.20mm |
| num_top_bottom         | 5 | 5 |
| top_bottom_thickness   | num_top_bottom * layer_height | 1.00mm |


### Clean Vertical Hole

Used to put more space on top of a vertical hole and avoid clean-up after printing

I first found this technique in Prusa OpenScad files, thanks for sharing!

Where
* h = layer_height
* a = 30째
* w = if the hole is too small, w will be equal or lower than 0. In this case I recommend to make the angle 'a' more vertical.

For holes smaller than 3mm diameter I make a simple triangle (no flat on top) with those values:
* h >= layer height
* a >= 30째
* w = 0


### Sharp Angle

When printing angles the filament take a small short-cut resulting in a rounded angle. After several tests (in PETG), I found that this geometry is doing perfectly squared angles. This is valid for angle printed perpendicularly to the bed.

Where
* e = extrusion width
* a = angle (45째 for a printed angle of 90째)

### Sanding

To get smooth surface from a 3D print

Thanks to JKSniper for this technique : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2307550 and https://youtu.be/0vgynnYzo08

#### Material
* Sandpaper 200, 500 and 800
* Spray filler
* Spray paint (acrylic), glossy or matt
* Bowl big enough to put your part in
* Water (in the bowl)

#### Steps
1. Sand as much as you can the edges using 200 sandpaper. Regularly put the sandpaper in water. At the end, surface should be smooth and even
1. Clean the part and dry it carefully
1. Mount the part in a way that you can spray all around
1. Spray with filler and let dry. Depending on the first sanding, apply one or more layers
1. Sand using firs 500 and then 800 sandpaper until it is smooth everywhere. Regularly put the sandpaper in water.
1. Clean, rinse carefully the part and let it dry
1. Spray the acrylic paint
